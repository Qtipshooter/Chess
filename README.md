# Chess
This is a small project I am making at this time to play with making games, menus, and mess with graphics.  This is also to do these things in C++ instead of C like my reversi project I did for a class

# To run (Windows only at this time)
- Download package
- Run SDL2_setup.bat
- Run GNUMake
- Run chess.exe
